# word-guessing-game
This is final project I have built in Code in Place 2021 hosted by Stanford. Public showcase:[Code in Place 2021](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2021/showcase/1119)
This app gets a random word from file and allows user guess letters of word. An user has only 8 incorect guesses  or needs to guess all letters to finsh game.
